1. GENERAL NOTES

TeraCopy is a compact program designed to copy and move files at the maximum
possible speed, also providing you with a lot of features. 

* Copy files faster. TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce 
  seek times. Asynchronous copy speeds up file transfer between two physical 
  hard drives.

* Pause and resume transfers. Pause copy process at any time to free up system
  resources and continue with a single click.

* Error recovery. In case of copy error, TeraCopy will try several times and 
  in the worse case just skips the file, not terminating the entire transfer.
  
* Interactive file list. TeraCopy shows failed file transfers and lets you fix
  the problem and recopy only problem files. 

* Shell integration. TeraCopy can completely replace Explorer copy and move 
  functions, allowing you work with files as usual. 

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
